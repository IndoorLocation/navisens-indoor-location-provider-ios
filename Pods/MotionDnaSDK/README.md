### Quick Start with CocoaPods

```
cd CocoapodsExample/MotionDnaSDKCocoaPodsExample
pod install
open CocoapodsExample/MotionDnaSDKCocoaPodsExample.xcworkspace
```

### Quick Start with Carthage

```
cd CarthageExample/MotionDnaSDKCarthageExample
carthage update --platform iOS
```
### Documentation

### Framework download

### Usage
1.Have your class inherit from our MotionDnaSDK class: 
```objectivec
@interface MotionDnaObject : MotionDnaSDK
```
2.Implement the following methods: 
```objectivec
-(void)receiveMotionDna:(MotionDna*)motionDna; // You will receive the data from this method.
// Method reports and error from the SDK signaling some type of issue.
// Errors:
// SENSOR_TIMING -> if timing between samples becomes inconsistent
// AUTHENTICATION_FAILED -> if authenticating to server failed
// SENSOR_MISSING -> if a crucial sensor is missing
// SDK_EXPIRED -> if the SDK expired
-(void)reportError:(ErrorCode)error WithMessage(NSString*)message;
// Location data from other devices in the room.
-(void)receiveNetworkData:(MotionDna *)motionDna;
// Receive custom messages from server and other devices.
-(void)receiveNetworkData:(NetworkCode)opcode WithPayload:(NSDictionary *)payload;
```
3.Initialize the SDK: 
```objectivec
MotionDnaObject * motionDnaObject_ = [[MotionDnaObject alloc] init];
```
4.Run the SDK: 
```objectivec
-(void)runMotionDna:(NSString*)ID;
```
5.Choose an initilization system: 
```objectivec
-(void)setLocationNavisens; //This lets us figure out the location from our prioprietary sensor fusion algorithms (may require walking 1-2 blocks) (recommended).
-(void)setLocationLatitude:(double)latitude Longitude:(double)longitude AndHeadingInDegrees:(double)heading; // This allows you to enter a start location and heading.
-(void)setLocationAndHeadingGPSMag; // This will initialize by setting the position to the latest GPS position and magnetic heading.
```

##How toâ€™s:
###Improve battery consumption:

###1/ Computation frequency

```
When initializing after having called runMotionDna, you can call setPowerMode:LOW_POWER,
this will reduce our estimation frequency therefore the amount of computations done every second.

```
###2/External location source<br/>
###2.1/ Using setLocationNavisens
```

When using setLocationNavisens, initialize our SDK with setExternalPositioningState:HIGH_ACCURACY (which is set by default),
after walking a bit you should receive NAVISENS_INITIALIZED as the [motionDna getLocation].locationStatus.

Once this has been received it means our SDK no longer requires external positioning sources, therefore
it is now safe call setExternalPositioningState with LOW_ACCURACY which will reduce the frequency at which
the GPS data is being polled to kilometer accuracy and still have our SDK work in background.

Note: setting the external positioning state to OFF will prevent our SDK from running in the background.

```
###2.2/ Using other input sources
```
If you wish to initialize without our auto initialization you can call setExternalPositioningState:LOW_ACCURACY
at startup and call our other initialization methods.

```
###2.3/ Swift

```swift
MotionDnaManager Class:

import Foundation
import MotionDnaSDK

class MotionDnaManager: MotionDnaSDK {

    func start() {
        runMotionDna("your-dev-key", receiver: self)
    }

    override func receive(_ motionDna: MotionDna!) {
        NSLog("%.8f %.8f %.8f %.8f\n", motionDna.getLocation().heading, motionDna.getLocation().localLocation.x, motionDna.getLocation().localLocation.y, motionDna.getLocation().localLocation.z)
    }

    override func failure(toAuthenticate msg: String!) {
    }

    override func reportSensorTiming(_ dt: Double, msg: String!) {
    }
}

ViewController Class:
class ViewController: UIViewController {

      var manager : MotionDnaManager!

      override func viewDidLoad() {
      	  super.viewDidLoad()
	  manager = MotionDnaManager()
	  manager.start()
      }

      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
      	  super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
      }
}

```
